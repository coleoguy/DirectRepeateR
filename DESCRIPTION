Description: RepeatFinder is a package for identifying and visualizing direct repeat sequences 
 in genome assemblies. Operating de novo, this package detects repeat sequences without 
 prior information, requiring only a genome assembly in FASTA format. It outputs detailed 
 locations of these repeats within the genome and provides tools for visualizing repeat 
 density across chromosomes, facilitating the analysis of genomic repeat patterns.
